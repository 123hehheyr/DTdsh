# Agent Note: Schedule as an opt-in optional bundle

Status: implemented

> Supersedes [Schedule in the shipped Web composition](../../archived/architecture/2026-09-24-web-default-schedule-composition.md): the `schedule` and `ui-schedule` rows now ship disabled, and switching them on is this bundle's job.

## Problem

`packages/bundle/web-app/cordis.patch.yml` inserts `time-context`, `schedule`, and `ui-schedule` with `disabled: true`, so the shipped Web composition mounts no Schedule service: no `schedule_*` tool is registered, no Session reminder catalog appears, and no Automation tasks page opens. The rows have no switch on the product surface; a deployment that wants them edits a profile patch layer or passes a `--patch` overlay, and both are configuration files a person using the shipped Web profile cannot reach. The per-step clock reading is preset-owned: the `standard`, `cordis`, and `ptc` presets declare it, and this bundle does not switch the Host `time-context` row on.

## Decision

The rows stay in the composition because an id-targeted patch overrides an existing row: a profile patch or a bundle sets a row's `disabled` to `false` without inserting it again.

`@deepseek-ai/dsh-experimental-schedule-bundle` (`packages/experimental/schedule-bundle/`) carries two id-targeted patches in its `cordis.patch.yml`, one for `schedule` and one for `ui-schedule`, each setting `disabled: false`; it inserts no row. `OPTIONAL_BUNDLES` in `packages/boot/app-boot/src/profile.ts` names the package, and `apps/cli` declares it as a runtime dependency, so every installation ships it switched off. The [experimental-as-optional-bundles decision](2026-09-21-experimental-capabilities-as-optional-bundles.md) owns the `OPTIONAL_BUNDLES` conventions and the localized `icon` and `meta.title` / `meta.description` metadata the Web Plugins page renders in its Official group.

Enabling the bundle turns on `schedule` (durable reminders, plus `schedule_create`, `schedule_list`, `schedule_update`, and `schedule_delete` on the live root Agents of the presets that declare the tool row) and `ui-schedule` (the Session reminder catalog and the Automation tasks page). The clock reading stays with the presets: `standard`, `cordis`, and `ptc` declare `time-context` beside the reminder tools that consume it ([preset-scoped time context](2026-09-24-preset-scoped-time-context.md)), and `minimal` declares neither, so switching the service on gives no `minimal` Agent a reading or a tool. The [Schedule subsystem](../../../../docs/subsystems/schedule.md) owns the durable records, delivery, and management operations; the [Web bundle](../../../../packages/bundle/web-app/README.md) owns the composition that carries the disabled rows. Disabling the bundle restores the shipped composition, and the Host stops scheduling while the `schedule` row stays disabled; stored task records remain in the Schedule domain.

## Alternatives considered

**Ship Schedule on by default.** Every live root Agent in the `standard`, `cordis`, and `ptc` presets then carries four tool schemas in each request header, and a conversation that never creates a reminder pays that cost. The arrangement also left the capability without an off switch on the product surface.

**Keep a `--patch` overlay file.** An overlay is a launch-time argument rather than a product-surface switch, so a person using the shipped Web profile cannot reach it. Re-declaring the rows through its `insert` list does not override them: `applyEntryPatches` appends that list without de-duplicating ids, and the Loader collapses the composed list to one entry per id with the last declaration winning, so the overlay replaces the Web bundle's rows instead of setting fields on them.

**Extract the rows out of the Web composition into the bundle.** The bundle would insert the rows instead of overriding them, so a profile that also declares one of those ids would have two declarations for it, of which the Loader keeps only the last. The disabled rows are what an override-style switch targets.

## Consequences

- A default `dsh web` session mounts no Schedule service: its live root Agents carry no `schedule_*` tool schemas, no Session reminder catalog appears, and no Automation tasks page opens. The `standard`, `cordis`, and `ptc` presets keep appending their per-step clock reading. An installation that wants the service enables the optional bundle from the Plugins page or lists the package in a profile's `dsh.profile.bundles`.
- An enabled installation adds four tool schemas to the live root Agents of the `standard`, `cordis`, and `ptc` presets, and `minimal` receives none of them. The clock reading is model-visible and durable, so it replays, compacts, and appears in exported Session logs like any other user message.
- A composition that does not carry the `schedule` and `ui-schedule` rows reports one `patch: entry <id> not found` warning per patch and mounts nothing from this bundle, and its package declares no plugin dependency, so enabling it cannot mount a Host service twice.
- The switch is configuration-only: `src/index.ts` is an empty module, the patch carries the runtime content, and the package owns no mutable runtime state, so it publishes no invariant companion.
